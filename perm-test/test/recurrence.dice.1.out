# TEST:
#     - gene .. the region label
#     - nObserved .. number of hits observed in input data in this gene
#     - nSimFewer .. number of simulations with fewer hits in the gene than observed in the data
#     - nSimEqual .. as above, but with the same number of hits than observed
#     - nSimExceeded .. as above, but with the more hits than observed
# DIST:
#     - gene
#     - nSimHits .. the number of simulations with 0,1,2,etc. hits in the gene
