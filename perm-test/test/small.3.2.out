# NITER_ROUNDS:
#    - number of iterations total
#    - number of batches
# NCALLS:
#    - number of calls used
#    - number of calls skipped because of their size or inaccessibility
# TEST_ENR:
#    - number of iterations
#    - number of times the simulation had the same or more hits than observed in input data
#    - P-value derived from the two fields
# TEST_DPL:
#    - number of iterations
#    - number of times the simulation had the same or fewer hits than observed in input data
#    - P-value derived from the two fields
# TEST_FOLD:
#    - number of hits in the input data
#    - average number of hits in simulations
#    - average of standard deviations approximated from each batch using the current average estimate
# DIST, the distribution of number of hits in the simulations:
#    - numbef of hits in a simulation: the start of the half-closed, half-open distribution bin [beg,end)
#    - numbef of hits in a simulation: the end of the half-closed, half-open distributin bin [beg,end)
#    - number of simulations with this many hits (raw count)
#    - number of simulations with this many hits (density)
